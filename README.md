#  Simple Buy

## üöÄ Motivation

**Simple Buy** is an experimental project aimed at exploring various API architectural styles within a unified application. Also using this  as a sandbox to assess the capabilities of [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and determine its viability as a replacement for Node.js in my Backend Development era.

##  API Architectural Styles Employed

This project integrates multiple API paradigms, each selected for its strengths in specific scenarios:

* **REST**: Handles primary CRUD operations for resources.
* **GraphQL**: Will use this for complex queries like fetching dashboards/analytics data.
* **WebSockets**: For real-time notifications and bidirectional communication between client and server.
* **SOAP**: For legacy payment gateways that require XML-based messaging protocols (none in mind yet).
* **gRPC**: Might split this project into micros-services and this will be used to trigger events between services.
* **Webhooks**: To allow external services receive real time data.
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Not Decided

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zufichris/simple-buy.git
   cd simple-buy
   ```



2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```



### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
bun run dev
```



The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
